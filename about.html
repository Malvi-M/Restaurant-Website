        Big bite is the most famous restaurant of the Rajkot city. The basic criteria of its setup is Quality, Service, Cleanliness & Value - an unflinching Big-biteâ€™s ideology that their customers must always get quality products, served quickly and with a smile, in a clean and pleasant environment, and all at a fair price. The basic source of inspiration was from view to have an international concept of the food items- "FAST FOOD" items, which is widely popular within almost all the metropolitan cities.

      <div class="text-center text-justify" style="margin-bottom: 20px">Established in 1955 as a small milk vendor dairy, Patel Vijay Dairy Farm extended itself to the # 1 dairy farm in the Rajkot. The primary objective was to provide best quality dairy products to rajkotees at truly affordable prices.

    In late seventies, the new Rajkot was seeking growth near racecourse which envisioned us to expand ourselves as Ice-cream manufacturer/vendor so we started our new venture, Patel Ice Cream, which is considered the # 1 in producing consistent taste in various ice cream products.

    In the year 2000, there were two big things that happened to Rajkot. One, the Y2K upshot and the birth of Big Bite.

    International quality food taste was considered as dream before the birth of Big Bite. Since its inception, due to its value for money food and qualitative offerings, Big Bite considered as the most beloved place for teenagers, youngsters and business persons.
